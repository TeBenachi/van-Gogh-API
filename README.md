### Note: Things to do 

(1) Add a button fuction to loop throught artworks

(2) Add credit link to Met museum open access




### Things I learned:

(1) Use Fetch to retrieve all Gogh's artwork ID (objectIds)

(2) Set up random select to pick an ID

(3) Then, use 2nd Fetch to get a specific artwork using a URL + a random ID from the previous step
